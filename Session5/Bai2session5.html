      Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American
      singer-songwriter. Known for her autobiographical songwriting, artistic
      reinventions, and cultural impact, Swift is a leading figure in popular
      music and the subject of widespread media coverage, with a vast fanbase
      known as Swifties. <br/>Swift signed to Big Machine Records in 2005, debuting
      as a country singer with the albums Taylor Swift (2006) and Fearless
      (2008). The singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" found crossover
      success on country and pop radio formats. She incorporated rock on Speak
      Now (2010) and electronic on Red (2012), later re-calibrating her image
      from country to pop with the synth-pop set 1989 (2014); the ensuing media
      scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-imbued Reputation (2017). The albums
      contained the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles “We Are Never Ever
      Getting Back Together,” “Shake It Off,” “Blank Space,” “Bad Blood,” and
      “Look What You Made Me Do.”
